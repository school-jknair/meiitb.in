<b>network</b> means a group
<b>computer network</b> means 2 or more connected computers can share resources like data and application, office machines or an internet connection
these computer interact with each other using a computer Language called <b>binary code</b> which consists of lot of 0 and 1 in a <b>specific order</b> 
<b>LAN</b>(Local Area Network)
<img src="images/1.1.landiagram.jpg" alt="" width="29%" height="60%">
This network span only a particular geographical location like an office building
In general, modern LANs can support hundreds or even thousands of devices, but the actual number of devices that can be connected will depend on the specific network configuration and the hardware and 
software used
It is best to split a big LAN into smaller logical zones known as <b>workgroups</b> to make administration easier 
In a typical business environment, it's good idea to arrange LAN's workgroups along department divisions; like for 
workgroup for Accounting 
workgroup for Sales 
workgroup for Marketing
workgroups can be interconnected using a device named <b>router</b>
common network components
workstations, a powerful computer that have resources to share 
Servers, a powerful computer that have specialized software for managing networks like network operating system. Some of the dedicated server for single tasks are:
  file server
  mail server
  print server 
Hosts, those machines with a identification number
A virtual local area network (VLAN) is a virtualized connection that connects multiple devices and network nodes from different LANs into one logical network. VLAN stands for Virtual Local Area Network, and 
it is a technique used in computer networking to create logical subnetworks within a physical local area network (LAN). The purpose of VLAN is to improve network efficiency, security, and manageability by 
grouping devices into separate broadcast domains, regardless of their physical location. The main purposes of VLANs include:
    Segmentation: VLANs allow network administrators to segment a large LAN into smaller logical networks. Devices within a VLAN can communicate with each other as if they were on the same LAN, but they 
    are isolated from devices in other VLANs. This helps to reduce network congestion and improve overall network performance.
    Security: VLANs can be used to isolate sensitive or critical devices from other devices on the network. This can help prevent unauthorized access and reduce the risk of security breaches. For example, 
    a engineering department's devices can be placed in a separate VLAN from the general employee devices, providing an additional layer of security.
    Broadcast control: In traditional LANs, broadcast traffic is typically sent to all devices in the broadcast domain, which can cause network congestion. With VLANs, broadcast traffic is limited to 
    devices within the same VLAN, reducing unnecessary broadcast traffic and improving network efficiency.
    Ease of management: VLANs allow for easier management of network resources by logically grouping devices based on their function, department, or location. Network administrators can apply consistent 
    policies, such as access control lists (ACLs) and Quality of Service (QoS) settings, to VLANs, making it easier to manage and enforce network policies across the organization.
    Flexibility: VLANs provide flexibility in network design and reconfiguration. Devices can be easily moved between VLANs without physically moving network cables, which makes it easier to adapt to 
    changes in network requirements or device locations.

A WAN is a group of LANs or other networks that communicate with one another. A WAN (wide-area network) is the technology that connects your offices, cloud applications, and cloud storage together. It is 
called a wide-area network because it spans beyond a single building or large campus to include multiple locations spread across a specific geographic area, or even the world. 
<img src="images/1.3.WAN.jpg" alt="" width="19%" height="40%">
The Internet is a global network of interconnected WANs. The word <b>internet</b> is from the word <b>internetwork</b>. 
MAC addresses(hardware address) are used for communication within a LAN, IP addresses are used for communication both within a LAN and across different LANs, including over the Internet
VPN(Virtual Private Network) is a technology that provides a secure and private connection over a public network, such as the Internet, by encrypting data and creating a virtual private tunnel for 
communication between two or more devices. The main purpose of a VPN is to enhance privacy and security by creating a secure communication channel between two or more devices over an untrusted network, 
such as the Internet. Here are some common use cases and purposes of VPNs:
    Secure Remote Access: VPNs are commonly used by remote workers or telecommuters to securely connect to their organization's internal network from outside the office. This allows employees to access 
    company resources, such as files, applications, and databases, securely over the Internet as if they were directly connected to the organization's internal network.
    Protecting Online Privacy: VPNs can be used to encrypt internet traffic and protect the privacy of users' online activities. By routing internet traffic through a VPN server, the user's IP address and 
    location are masked, making it more difficult for websites, advertisers, and other entities to track and monitor their online activities.
    Bypassing Geographical Restrictions: VPNs can be used to bypass geographical restrictions or censorship imposed by governments or content providers. By connecting to a VPN server located in a different 
    country, users can access region-restricted content or services that may not be available in their own country.
    Secure Public Wi-Fi Usage: Public Wi-Fi networks, such as those found in coffee shops, airports, and hotels, are often unsecured and can be vulnerable to eavesdropping and other security threats. Using 
    a VPN on a public Wi-Fi network can encrypt data and protect against potential security risks.
    Enhanced Security for Data Transfer: VPNs can provide an additional layer of security for data transfer between devices, such as between branch offices of an organization or between business 
    partners. VPNs can encrypt data to protect it from unauthorized access or interception during transit.
    Protecting Personal Information: VPNs can be used to encrypt personal information, such as credit card numbers, usernames, and passwords, when using online banking, online shopping, or other sensitive 
    online activities, to protect against potential data breaches or identity theft.

VLAN is a good solution if the host is a part of the network which is physically local 
VPN is a better solution if the host is part of the network which is physically remote 
Peer-to-peer (P2P) and client/server are two different types of networking architectures used in computer networks.
Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Networking:
    In a P2P network, all devices are considered equal and can act as both clients and servers. Each device on the network can share resources, such as files, printers, and services, directly with other 
    devices without relying on a central server. P2P networks do not have a central authority or control, and devices communicate with each other in a decentralized manner. Examples of P2P networking 
    include file sharing applications like BitTorrent and decentralized communication applications like Skype.
    <img src="images/1.5.peertopeer.jpg" alt="" width="19%" height="40%">
Client/Server Networking:
    In a client/server network, there are dedicated servers that provide services, and client devices request and consume these services. Clients are typically end-user devices, such as desktop computers, 
    laptops, tablets, or smartphones, that connect to servers to access resources and services, such as files, databases, email, and web pages. Servers are powerful computers or systems that are responsible 
    for managing and delivering resources and services to clients.

Physical topology refers to the physical layout or arrangement of devices and cables in a computer network. It defines how devices are connected to each other and how data flows between them in a 
physical sense. Physical topology is concerned with the actual physical connections and configurations of network devices, such as computers, switches, routers, hubs, and cables, in the network 
infrastructure. Some common physical network topologies:
    Bus Topology: In a bus topology, all devices are connected to a common communication medium, typically a single cable. Each device shares the same communication medium and can communicate with 
    other devices by transmitting data on the shared cable.
    Star Topology: In a star topology, all devices are connected to a central hub or switch. The hub or switch acts as a central point for data communication, and devices communicate with each other 
    through the hub or switch.
    Ring Topology: In a ring topology, devices are connected in a circular loop, where each device is connected to the device next to it, forming a closed loop. Data is transmitted in one direction 
    around the ring, and each device regenerates and passes the data to the next device until it reaches the destination device.
    Mesh Topology: In a mesh topology, devices are interconnected with multiple redundant paths, creating a highly interconnected network. Mesh topologies can be either full mesh, where every device is 
    connected to every other device, or partial mesh, where only some devices have redundant connections.
    Tree (Hierarchical) Topology: In a tree topology, devices are organized in a hierarchical structure, similar to a tree. Devices are connected in multiple levels, with a root device at the top and 
    branches of devices branching out from the root. Devices in the tree topology can communicate with devices in the same branch or with devices in higher or lower branches.
    Hybrid Topology: A hybrid topology is a combination of two or more different topologies. For example, a network can have a combination of star and bus topologies, or a combination of ring and mesh 
    topologies. Hybrid topologies are often used to take advantage of the strengths of different topologies in different parts of a network.

In a typical network architecture, the <b>network backbone</b> connects different <b>network segments</b> to enable communication between them. 
Network Backbone: The network backbone, also known as the backbone network or simply backbone, refers to the main high-speed, high-capacity communication links that connect different segments or 
subnetworks within a larger network. The backbone is responsible for carrying data traffic between different parts of the network and acts as a central conduit for data transmission. It is typically 
designed to handle high bandwidth and is used to interconnect major network components, such as switches, routers, and servers. The backbone is a critical part of a network infrastructure and is 
typically built with redundant links for high availability and fault tolerance. Some common types of network backbones include:
    Wired Ethernet Backbone: This is the most traditional and widely used type of network backbone. It uses Ethernet cables, such as Cat5e or Cat6 cables, to establish wired connections between 
    network devices, such as switches, routers, and servers. Wired Ethernet backbones are known for their reliability, scalability, and high performance, making them suitable for large networks 
    with high bandwidth requirements.    
    Fiber Optic Backbone: Fiber optic backbones use fiber optic cables to transmit data as pulses of light, allowing for much higher bandwidth and longer distances compared to copper-based Ethernet 
    backbones. Fiber optic backbones are ideal for networks that require long-distance connectivity, high data rates, and immunity to electromagnetic interference (EMI). They are commonly used in 
    large enterprise networks, data centers, and metropolitan area networks (MANs) where high-speed and long-distance connectivity are essential.    
    Wireless Backbone: Wireless backbones use wireless technologies, such as Wi-Fi or microwave links, to establish wireless connections between network devices. Wireless backbones are typically 
    used in scenarios where running physical cables is impractical or cost-prohibitive, such as in remote or outdoor environments. Wireless backbones are less common than wired or fiber optic 
    backbones and are typically used in smaller networks or as supplemental connectivity options in conjunction with wired backbones.    
    Virtual Backbone: A virtual backbone, also known as a logical backbone or a virtual LAN (VLAN) backbone, is a logical or virtual grouping of network segments or VLANs that are interconnected 
    using network switches or routers. VLANs are created by dividing a physical network into smaller logical segments, allowing for network segmentation, improved security, and better network 
    management. VLAN backbones are commonly used in large networks where logical segmentation is desired without the need for physically separate backbone cabling.    
    Cloud-based Backbone: Cloud-based backbones utilize cloud-based networking services, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), software-defined wide area networks (SD-WANs), or cloud 
    interconnects, to establish a virtual network backbone over the Internet or other public or private cloud networks. Cloud-based backbones are ideal for distributed networks or organizations 
    that rely on cloud-based resources and services, providing flexible and scalable connectivity options without the need for physical backbone infrastructure.
    <img src="images/1.8.backbone.jpg" alt="" width="29%" height="40%">
Network Segment: A network segment, also known as a network segment or a LAN segment, refers to a smaller portion of a larger network that is separated by network devices, such as switches or 
routers. A network segment may consist of a group of devices, such as computers, servers, printers, and other networked devices, that are connected to the same local area network (LAN) or a 
virtual LAN (VLAN) and can communicate directly with each other without the need for intermediate routing or switching. Network segments are used to divide a large network into smaller manageable 
parts, improve network performance, and manage network traffic.
The purpose of a protocol is to establish a common understanding and agreement among participants in a communication or interaction process. Protocols define the format, structure, and sequence of 
data exchanged, as well as the rules for error detection, correction, and handling.
<b>OSI</b> stands for Open Systems Interconnection. It is a conceptual model that describes how network communication occurs between different computer systems or devices. The OSI model was developed 
by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in the 1980s as a reference framework for understanding and standardizing network communication protocols. The OSI model consists of seven 
layers, each representing a specific function or task in the network communication process. These layers are:

    All People Seem To Need Data Processing
Connection-oriented and connectionless communication are two different approaches to transmitting data in computer networks.
    Connection-oriented communication: In connection-oriented communication, a reliable and established connection is first established between the sender and receiver before data transfer occurs. This 
    connection is maintained throughout the entire data transfer process, and both the sender and receiver exchange control information to ensure that the data is received correctly. Examples of 
    connection-oriented protocols include TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), which is used in the TCP/IP protocol suite commonly used in the Internet, and the X.25 protocol.
    Connectionless communication: In connectionless communication, data packets are transmitted independently without establishing a dedicated connection between the sender and receiver. Each packet is 
    treated as an independent unit and can take different routes to reach the destination. The receiver does not send any acknowledgment or control information back to the sender, and the responsibility 
    for ensuring reliable delivery of data is typically handled by higher-level protocols or applications. Examples of connectionless protocols include UDP (User Datagram Protocol), which is also used 
    in the TCP/IP protocol suite, and the IP (Internet Protocol) itself.
On a connection-oriented communication
    In the case of TCP, a series of steps known as the "three-way handshake" will establish for a connection and start exchanging data packets 
        SYN (Synchronize): The process begins with the sender (client) sending a SYN packet to the receiver (server) to initiate a connection request. The SYN packet contains information such as 
        the source and destination IP addresses, port numbers, and a randomly generated sequence number.
        SYN-ACK (Synchronize-Acknowledge): If the receiver (server) is willing to establish a connection, it responds with a SYN-ACK packet. The SYN-ACK packet acknowledges the receipt of the 
        SYN packet, contains its own randomly generated sequence number, and indicates the readiness to establish a connection.
        ACK (Acknowledge): Finally, the sender (client) sends an ACK packet to acknowledge the receipt of the SYN-ACK packet. This completes the three-way handshake process, and a connection 
        is established between the sender and receiver. The ACK packet typically contains the next sequence number that the sender is expecting to receive.
    To terminate a connection, similar process with FIN (Finish) and FIN-ACK (Finish-Acknowledge) packets to gracefully close the connection.

There are several popular cables used for networking, including:
    Coaxial Cable: Coaxial cables are used for various networking applications, including cable TV, internet, and CCTV systems. They have a central conductor surrounded by an insulating layer, a 
    metal shield, and an outer insulating layer. Coaxial cables are capable of carrying high-frequency signals and are commonly used in environments where high-quality signal transmission is 
    important. Coaxial cable is primarily used by cable TV companies to connect their satellite antenna facilities to customer homes and businesses. For many networking applications, twisted pair 
    Ethernet cables, such as Cat 5e, Cat 6, Cat 6a, and Cat 7, have become more prevalent due to their higher bandwidth, faster data transfer speeds, and ease of installation. These cables are 
    commonly used in bus topologies
    <img src="images/3.1.coaxialcable.jpg" alt="" width="19%" height="40%">
    Twisted pair cable: Twisted pair cables are a type of cabling commonly used for networking and telecommunications. They consist of pairs of insulated copper wires that are twisted together in a 
    specific pattern to reduce interference and improve performance. The twisting of the wires helps to cancel out electromagnetic interference (EMI) and radio frequency interference (RFI) that can 
    occur during data transmission, allowing for more reliable and higher-quality signal transmission. Twisted pair cables are widely used to transmit data signals between devices such as computers, 
    routers, switches, and access points. These cables are commonly used in star topologies, ring topology and mesh topology. There are two main types of twisted pair cables:
        Shielded Twisted Pair (STP) cables: STP cables, also known as screened twisted pair (ScTP) cables, are similar to UTP cables, but they have an additional layer of shielding around the twisted 
        pairs. This shielding provides extra protection against electromagnetic interference (EMI) and radio frequency interference (RFI). STP cables are less common compared to UTP cables and are 
        typically used in specific networking environments that require higher levels of EMI and RFI protection, such as in industrial settings or in areas with high electromagnetic interference. Here 
        are the commonly used color combinations for STP cables:   
            TIA/EIA 568A:
                Pair 1: White/Blue (TIP with foil shield), Blue (RING with foil shield) - Typically used for Transmit Data (Tx+/-) or Data+
                Pair 2: White/Orange (TIP with foil shield), Orange (RING with foil shield) - Typically used for Receive Data (Rx+/-) or Data-

        Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP) cables: UTP cables are the most common type of twisted pair cables used in networking. They consist of pairs of insulated copper wires that are twisted together 
        without any additional shielding. UTP cables are used in various Ethernet cable categories, such as Cat 5e, Cat 6, Cat 6a, and Cat 7, and are typically color-coded for easy identification 
        and termination. Here are the commonly used color combinations for UTP cables:

        The following are some of the most common Ethernet standards that utilize UTP cables:
        <img src="images/3.5.2.UTPcableproperties.jpg" alt="" width="49%" height="40%">
        TIA/EIA 568A and TIA/EIA 568B are two different wiring standards for Ethernet cabling, specified by the Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) and the Electronic Industries 
        Alliance (EIA). These standards define the pinout and color coding for the various pairs of wires used in Ethernet cabling, specifically for 10BASE-T and 100BASE-TX Ethernet networks.
        The naming conventions for STP and UTP cables in Ethernet standards typically follow similar patterns. Here's a general guide on how STP and UTP cables are typically named:
            Data Transfer Rate: The data transfer rate, which indicates the speed at which data can be transmitted over the network, is usually specified as a number in Mbps, Gbps, or higher.
            Cable Type: The cable type, whether it's STP or UTP, may be indicated in the naming convention. For example, "T" typically indicates UTP cables, while "F" or "X" may indicate fiber 
            optic cables, and "S" or "L" may indicate STP cables.
            Maximum Distance: The maximum distance that data can be transmitted over the network using the specified cable type is usually indicated in the naming convention. This distance is usually 
            expressed in meters or feet and indicates the maximum length of the cable that can be used for network connections.
            Other Parameters: Some standards may include additional parameters, such as the encoding scheme used for data transmission, the type of connectors used, or other specifications.
        "10GBASE-T" is an Ethernet standard that specifies 
            "10G" in the name indicates the data transfer rate of 10 Gbps
            "BASE" indicates that it uses baseband signaling, which means that the entire bandwidth of the cable is dedicated to carrying Ethernet data
            "T" indicates that twisted pair copper cables are used for network connections
        "Cat" stands for "Category" and refers to a classification system used for Ethernet cables that indicates the performance and capabilities of the cable. Different Cat versions correspond to 
        different standards set by the TIA/EIA for Ethernet cabling. Overview of the main differences between these Cat versions:

    Fiber Optic Cable: Fiber optic cables are used for high-speed and long-distance networking applications. They use light to transmit data, offering faster data transfer rates and better immunity to 
    interference compared to Ethernet cables. Fiber optic cables are commonly used in data centers, telecommunication networks, and other environments where high bandwidth and long-distance 
    transmission are required. These cables are commonly used in ring topologies and mesh topology. There are several different modes of fiber optic cables available, which refer to the way light 
    travels within the fiber core. 
    <img src="images/3.2.fibreopticcables.jpg" alt="" width="19%" height="40%">
    The most common modes of fiber optic cables are:
        Single-mode (SM): Single-mode fiber optic cables have a small core diameter (typically 9/125 µm or 8.3/125 µm) and allow for only one mode, a single path of light propagation , of light to 
        travel through the core. Single-mode fibers are designed for long-distance transmission and are used in high-bandwidth applications such as long-haul telecommunications, data centers, and 
        campus networks. Single-mode fiber is using laser as the source of the light for transmission of the optical signal and transmission media is glass.
        Multimode (MM): Multimode fiber optic cables have a larger core diameter (typically 50/125 µm or 62.5/125 µm) and allow for multiple modes, allows for multiple modes of light propagation, 
        of light to travel through the core. Multimode fibers are typically used for shorter distances, such as within buildings or campuses, and are suitable for lower-bandwidth applications such 
        as local area networks (LANs), premises cabling, and some data center applications. Multimode fiber is using LEDs as the source of the light for transmission of the optical signal and cables 
        are available in glass or in a plastic version. Single mode cables are meant for long distance, while multimode is often used for shorter distances

        Within multimode fibers, there are also different types of multimode fibers that are optimized for different performance characteristics:

    There are several types of fiber optic connectors commonly used in the industry, including:
        SC (Subscriber Connector): SC connectors are one of the most widely used fiber optic connectors. They have a square-shaped push-pull mechanism for easy insertion and removal, and they provide 
        low insertion loss and high return loss.        
        LC (Lucent Connector): LC connectors are small form-factor connectors that use a 1.25 mm ferrule, making them half the size of SC connectors. They are commonly used in high-density applications 
        and provide low insertion loss and high return loss.        
        ST (Straight Tip): ST connectors are one of the older types of fiber optic connectors and are commonly used in older networks. They have a round, bayonet-style coupling mechanism and use 
        a 2.5 mm ferrule.        
        FC (Ferrule Connector): FC connectors use a threaded coupling mechanism and a 2.5 mm ferrule. They are commonly used in applications that require high precision and stability, such as in 
        laboratory settings.        
        MTP/MPO (Multi-Fiber Push-On/Pull-Off): MTP/MPO connectors are used for multi-fiber cables and provide high-density connectivity. They have a push-pull mechanism and can accommodate multiple 
        fibers in a single connector, making them ideal for data centers and high-speed networks.        
        MT-RJ (Mechanical Transfer Registered Jack): MT-RJ connectors are duplex connectors that combine a fiber optic connection with a copper RJ-style connector in a single housing. They are 
        commonly used in residential and small office/home office (SOHO) applications.
        E2000: E2000 connectors have a spring-loaded shutter that protects the fiber when not in use, making them ideal for applications that require dust and dirt protection. They provide low 
        insertion loss and high return loss.

Two types of Ethernet cables that are used for different purposes in networking
    Straight-through cable: A straight-through cable is the most common type of Ethernet cable used to connect different types of networking devices, such as computers to switches, routers, or 
    modems. In a straight-through cable, the pinout assignments on one end of the cable are exactly mirrored on the other end, meaning that the wires are connected in the same sequence from one 
    end to the other. Straight-through cables typically use use either T568A or T568B wiring standard, which define the pinout assignments for each wire pair in the cable, where pins 1, 2, 3, 
    and 6 are used for transmitting and pins 4, 5, 7, and 8 are used for receiving.
    Crossover cable: A crossover cable, also known as a crossover patch cable or simply a crossover, is a special type of Ethernet cable used to connect similar types of networking devices directly 
    to each other, such as computers to computers, switches to switches, or routers to routers. In a crossover cable, the pinout assignments on one end of the cable are crossed over or swapped with 
    the pinout assignments on the other end, hence the name "crossover". This means that the transmit (Tx) pins on one end are connected to the receive (Rx) pins on the other end, and vice 
    versa. Crossover cables are typically used in scenarios where devices with similar functionalities need to communicate with each other without the need for an intermediate networking device, such 
    as a switch or a router. This type of cable use T568A wiring standard on one end and T568B wiring standard on the other end. The wiring configuration for T568A and T568B is typically as follows:
        T568A wiring standard(either end):
            Pin 1: White/Green (TX+)
            Pin 2: Green (TX-)
            Pin 3: White/Orange (RX+)
            Pin 4: Blue (Not used)
            Pin 5: White/Blue (Not used)
            Pin 6: Orange (RX-)
            Pin 7: White/Brown (Not used)
            Pin 8: Brown (Not used)
        T568B wiring standard(other end):
            Pin 1: White/Orange (TX+)
            Pin 2: Orange (TX-)
            Pin 3: White/Green (RX+)
            Pin 4: Blue (Not used)
            Pin 5: White/Blue (Not used)
            Pin 6: Green (RX-)
            Pin 7: White/Brown (Not used)
            Pin 8: Brown (Not used)
