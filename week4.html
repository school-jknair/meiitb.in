        Week 4

        talk about marketing strategy through 4 Ps—product, price, and place, promotion
        very important concept in marketing known as marketing mix or popularly called as '4Ps'
        Objective
        Define the term 'product'
        Describe the various levels of product and different product classifications
        Demonstrate the product mix concepts
        Explain branding and branding decisions
        A <b>marketing strategy</b> refers to a business's overall game plan for reaching prospective consumers and turning them into customers of their products or services
        Marketing strategy is about achieving your marketing objectives through proper analysis of the marketing mix namely
            Product
            Price
            Place
            Promotion
        proper combination of these four elements (4Ps) is the key to the success of any marketing process.
        Product is a major carrier of consumer value
        To achieve market leadership, firms must offer products of superior quality that provide unsurpassed customer value


        Product 
        A product is anything that can be offered to the market to satisfy a need or want.
A product can be visualized in multiple levels. The levels are: Core level, Basic Product, Expected Product, Augmented Product and Potential Product.
Products are generally classified into four types. They are: convenience goods, shopping goods, specialty goods and unsought goods
A product mix is also called product assortment, which is the set of all products and items a particular seller offers for sale.
A product mix for any organization has got 4 properties: Length, Breadth, Depth and Consistency.
Brands is defined as a name, term, sign, symbol, design or combination of them, intended to identify the goods and services of one seller or group of sellers and differentiate them from competitors.
Brand related decisions include: brand sponsor decision, brand name decision and brand strategy decision.


A product can be visualized in multiple levels. And each of these level contribute
synergistically to create the product. The levels are core, basic, expected, augmented, and
potential. I'll talk about this a little more. See, the first one is the core product level. As the
name suggests, it is the core. This explains the reason for which the consumer is making the
purchase. This level explains the reason "why". The "why" of buying the product or the core
benefit of buying the product. Let's take the example of a hotel. In hotel, when a customer is
checking in, essentially he is buying rest and sleep, that is, the core reason. However, this
core is expressed through the basic product. The basic product is one through which the
core benefit is delivered to the customer. So, continuing with the same example of a hotel, a
hotel room includes a bed, a bathroom, towel, desk, etc. So, these are the basic benefits, the
basic products through which the core benefit is extrapolated. The core benefit is delivered.

The next level is the expected product. So, the expected product is the set of attributes that
the consumers normally expect when they buy the product. So, when a customer books a
hotel room, you'll be expecting a fresh towel, clean pillows, clean bed, new soap, a working
TV, a fan, AC, whatever. Now, you must have guessed it by now that it is expected is a
function of what others are doing. Expected product depends upon the market. That is what
the other hotels are providing. If all other hotels are providing HDTV with cable channels,
then that is expected. If they are not providing, then it is not be expected, it will be
augmented.

So, that leads to the fourth level of product, which is augmented product. The one in which
the attributes that exceeds customer expectation, which leads to happiness or in marketing
terms it is called customer delight. So, if I take the same example of hotel room, the
customers find that hotel room provides free dinner, complimentary breakfast, probably a
fruit basket, probably a mini bar inside, probably a set of DVD players. So, these are the kind
of things that make people happy. So, this is augmented. See, again I am repeating, this
expected and augmented, they depend upon what the market is offering.

The last level of the product is the potential product. A potential product covers all possible
augmentations and all possible transformations that a product may go through in future,
which leads to customer delight. So, a library of DVD collections, complimentary spa
treatment, range of exotic gourmet food, wines—all these let your imagination go wild—all
these things will have when you travel next, probably.
