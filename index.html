- Selecting one specific segment or two-three segments
- Designing a set of meaningful differences to distinguish the company’s offerings from competitor’s offerings for the selected segment

    Geographic
    Demographic
    Psychographic

- The term 'demographics' indicates vital and measurable statistics of human population. Often-used demographic variables are: age, gender, marital status, education, occupation, income and family size
- Segmentation based on the internal self of consumers is known as psychographic segmentation
- While demographics provides the marketer with the 'who' aspect, psychographics provides the 'why' aspect
- Behavioral segmentation divides a population based on their behaviour, with respect to their purchase and usage of the products

<b>Targeting</b>
- Targeting means selecting one or more identified segments and concentrating on those segments rather than the whole market
- The criteria for selecting target market are 
    segment's size and growth
    segment’s structural attractiveness
    organization’s objectives and resources

    single segment concentration
    selective specialization
    product specialization
    market specialization 
    whole market coverage

<b>Differentiation</b>
- Differentiation is the act of designing a set of meaningful differences to distinguish the company’s offerings from competitor’s offerings.
- Undifferentiated marketing assumes the lack of significant differences among the consumers and their requirements.
- A niche market is the subset of an identified segment on which a specific product is focused. 
- Differentiation Parameters include 
    product differentiation
    service differentiation
    personnel differentiation
    differentiation based on channel and imagery.
- A ‘Competitor’ is anyone who provides the same offering to the same target segment.
