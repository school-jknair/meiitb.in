A <b>marketing strategy</b> refers to a business's overall game plan for reaching prospective consumers and turning them into customers of their products or services

<b>Building blocks of marketing strategy</b> 
- breaking the market into segments 
- selecting one specific segment or two-three segments
- identify competitors on the selected segments
- designing a set of meaningful differences to distinguish the company’s offerings from competitor’s offerings for the selected segments
- create a positive image in the mind of the prospective consumers to maximize the potential benefit to the firm

<b>Segmentation</b>
- The process of dividing the market into various homogeneous groups based on some common parameters is called 'Segmentation'
- Fundamental "bases for segmentation" of consumer market. They are as follows, 
    1.geographic(what) ie, region, city size, density of population, climate
    2.demographic(who) ie, births, deaths, marriages, age, income, education, occupation
    3.psychographic(why) its psychology+demography ie, lifestyle, their activities, interests, personality, likes and dislikes etc
    4.behavioral(how) ie, customers approach to making purchase decision and usage of the product or service
- The term 'demographics' indicates vital and measurable statistics of human population. ie, age, gender, marital status, education, occupation, income and family size
- Segmentation based on the internal self of consumers is known as psychographic segmentation
- Behavioral segmentation divides a population based on their behaviour
    1.needs and benefits, eg: in case of pad locks, jewellery safety is the need and jewellery worth is the benefit
    2.decision roles

    3.user and usage pattern, (existing customer only)
        #user status
            <img src="images/user-non-user.JPG" width="8%">
        #buyer readiness
            <img src="images/buyer-readiness-stages.JPG" width="45%">
        #usage rate
            @heavy user, somebody uses shampoo two times or three times a day
            @light user, somebody uses shampoo once a week
        #loyalty status, loyalty a strong feeling of support or allegiance to a brand
            @hard-core loyals, who buy the same brand all the time. IT companies like Apple or Google have many loyal customers.
            @split loyals, split between 2 or 3 brands. These type of customers do not go crazy for one brand only they are OK with 2-3 brands(OK to travel with both Cox & Kings or Thomas cook)
            @shifting loyals, shift between 10 or more brands. However, shifting loyals is less loyal than split loyals
            @switchers, with no loyalty. Keep switching even when they liked a brand this is because they want to experience new things
        #purchase occasion, ie, special occasion like festivals or office party or your regular purchase

<b>Targeting</b>
- Targeting means selecting one or more identified segments and concentrating on those segments rather than the whole market
- The criteria for selecting the target market/s are 
    1.segment's size and growth

    1.single segment concentration
    2.selective specialization

<b>Differentiation</b>
- Differentiation is the act of designing a set of meaningful differences to distinguish the company’s offerings from competitor’s offerings.
