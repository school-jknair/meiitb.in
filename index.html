<hr>
<b id="id_price_detail">Price</b>
- Objective - determine the adequate price for any product or service (pricing decision)
- For companies, it provides revenue; and for consumers, it is the cost
- A graph for quantity demanded vs price is called the demand curve
    <img src="images/demand-curve.JPG" alt="" width="25%">
- Elasticity of Demand refers to the change of demand for every change of price 
- Elastic demand means a significant change in quantity demanded when the small price gets changed
- Inelastic demand means the slight or no change in quantity demanded when the price gets changed (either reduced or increased)
- Different types of costs
    # Fixed costs are costs that do not change with increase or decrease in production level or sales revenue. eg, a company must pay for rent, salaries for employees, electricity bill, etc.
    # Variable costs are costs that vary directly with the level of production. eg, raw materials, packaging materials, transportation, etc
- Total cost = Fixed + Variable costs 
- Average cost = Total cost / Number of units, is the cost per unit at that level of production
- Break Even refers to the revenues needed to cover a company's total expenses
- Break-even point (BEP) is the point at which costs and revenue are equal. At this point there is no loss or no gain
- Break even calculation
    # Total fixed costs: ₹500,000, Variable costs per unit: ₹300, Sale price per unit: ₹500
    # Break-even Unit Volume = Fixed Costs/(SP per Unit – VC per unit) ie, Break-even Unit Volume = 500,000/ (500 – 300) = 2,500 units to cover the costs or reach break even point
    # 2,500 units x ₹500 = ₹1,250,000 of total sales to cover the costs or reach break even point or before any profits are realized
- Process of Price Setting
    # Decide the pricing objective(ലക്ഷ്യം) eg, maximising profits, increasing sales volume, matching competitors' prices, deterring competitors or just pure survival
    # Determining the demand(DTD) provides the base for setting a price ceiling(max amount allowed for a product or service). Demand is a function of desire, ability, and willingness
    <img src="images/demand-formula.JPG" alt="" width="35%">
    # Estimating costs provides base for price setting
        @ Identify the types of costs (fixed cost and variable cost)
        @ Determine the per unit cost of your product (price should cover manufacturing cost +  marketing cost + profit desired by the company)
    # Analyzing competitors’ costs, prices, and offers (determine pricing parameters of your competitors will help you to decide our own pricing)
    # Decide a pricing method, to set the specific price level that achieves companies goals and objectives, marketers make use of various pricing methods
        @ Pricing based on producers prespective
            $ Markup Pricing, adding a percentage to a cost to determine its selling price. Mark up price = unit cost / (1 – desired profit on sales)
            $ Target return Pricing, expecting the return based on the investment. Unit cost + ((desired return * invested capital)/ unit sales)
        @ pricing based on consumers  prespective
            $ Perceived value pricing, value which customers are willing to pay.
            $ Value pricing, provide higher value to consumers ie, reducing price point, reorganize experience of shopping, etc. Few variants are 
                % loss leader pricing, reduce the price of grocery store staples (milk, meat, and eggs) to bare cost as loss leaders so customers might by other items
                % EDLP(every day low pricing), low price without the need to wait for sale price events or comparison shopping
            $ Going rate pricing, follow the leader pricing method. New players will follow the leader since the price is pre-defined
            $ Sealed bid pricing, B2B, tendering process
            $ Psychological pricing, eg, bata pricing or high pricing to show quality
    # Setting the Final Price 
        @ Company's pricing objectives
        @ Company's pricing policy
        @ Needs and wants of the target consumer
        @ Impact of other marketing activities ie, brand's quality, advertising related to the competition, etc
        @ Impact of price on the other parties like other stakeholders such as dealers, distributors, salesperson, suppliers
        @ Once the price is decided then review into these factors and say that whether the price is correct and then say, okay, this is done
<hr>
<b id="id_place_detail">Place</b> 
- Place means distribution channels, how the product will reach the customers (smooth flow of products)
- Distribution channels can be viewed as a set of interdependent organizations involved in the process of making a product or service available for consumption to the end consumer

    # Dealers
    # Company's own sales force
    # Retailers
- Wholesalers
- It involves buying / procuring in bulk from the manufacturer and selling it to the next member (mostly retailer) in the distribution channel in their desired quantity
- It is a commercial establishment that purchases in bulk from various manufacturers, stocks the items then offers complete assortment of the specified merchandise for resale to the retail stores
- It may be differentiated into various categories based on the functions carried out by them
    # Merchant, who takes title of the merchandise procured, buys the items from the manufacturer
        @ Full function wholesaler, provides a full set of functions 
        @ Limited service wholesaler, provides only part of functions
    # Agent, do not take title or ownership. They are primarily involved in making the buying and selling parties meet, help in striking a deal, and pocket their fees
    # Manufacturer's own sales force or branch offices, these offices usually carry little inventory and primarily take orders for the merchandise, either full or limited service provideres
- Retailers
- Business activities involved in selling goods and services to the final consumer for their personal or household use
- Procured the merchandise from the manufacturer or wholesaler in bulk and sell it to the end consumer in smaller quantities
- Characterics of retailing 
    # Like large number of transactions
    # Less margin for transactions
    # Average size of transactions is quite less
- Retailing in emerging economies is divided into two distinct categories
    # Traditional or unorganized sector
    # Modern or organized sector
- Types of Retail Formats
    # Department store, a large shop stocking products in different departments
        @ Yes on customer cervices
        @ All of his daily needs products from pin to lan or needle to car
        @ Soft and hard goods
        @ Departmental basis
        @ eg, MAX, splash, lifestyle, Carrefour
    # Specialty stores, specialization on products and expertise and store carries a deep assortment within a narrow line of goods
        @ Yes on customer Services
        @ Florists, furniture stores,  sporting-goods stores, and bookstores
        @ eg, HomeCenter
    # ‘Mom and Pop’ and ‘Kirana’ stores, these are traditional independent convenience stores
        @ Yes on customer cervices
        @ High prices
        @ Cater to mostly local population
        @ Unorganized sector
    # Discount store, a shop that sells goods at less than the normal retail price
        @ No on customer service
        @ Low prices

        @ eg, Walmart and Kmart
    # Supermarket, a large self-service shop selling foods and household goods, aim to meet all their consumer's weekly needs
        @ No on customer service
        @ Low prices
        @ Large
        @ High-volume
        @ Eg, Big Bazaar, Reliance Fresh
- Distribution channel level, the number of intermediaries between the producer and the consumer. 
    # Direct marketing channel (0 level), it does not have any intermediaries, goods directly go from the manufacturer to the customer eg, personal selling, telemarketing, manufacturers' own stores, or B2B
    # Indirect marketing channel, we have multiple levels
        @ 1 level, only one intermediary namely retailer. Manufacturer to retailer to the end consumer        
        @ 2 level, manufacturer to wholesaler to retailer to end consumer        
        @ 3 level, manufacturer to distributor to wholesaler to retailer to end consumer. Distributors are attached to the manufacturer where a wholesaler can carry products of different manufacturers
        <img src="images/all-level-distribution-channel.JPG" alt="" srcset="" width="42%">
- Type of market for serving
    # Industrial products use direct marketing channel
    # Consumer products use indirect marketing channel for reaching mass base of consumers and more penetration
- 3 distinct types of distribution systems to choose from
    # Intensive—maximum coverage through all possible outlets. As many distributors, dealers, wholesalers, retailers engaged with all of them and try to reach as many consumers through as many outlets
    # Selective—limited number of outlets in specific geographic areas target consumers
    # Exclusive—only one channel member, it could be a distributor, it could be a wholesaler, it could be retailer
- Systematic approach for designing channels involves the following steps
