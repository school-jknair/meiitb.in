<b id="id_price_detail">Price</b>
<img src="images/4Ps.jpeg" alt="" width="30%">
- Objective - determine the adequate price for any product or service (pricing decision)
- For companies, it provides revenue; and for consumers, it is the cost
- A graph for quantity demanded vs price is called the demand curve
    <img src="images/demand-curve.JPG" alt="" width="25%">
- Elasticity of Demand refers to the change of demand for every change of price 
- Elastic demand means a significant change in quantity demanded when the small price gets changed
- Inelastic demand means the slight or no change in quantity demanded when the price gets changed (either reduced or increased)
- Different types of costs
    # Fixed costs are costs that do not change with increase or decrease in production level or sales revenue. eg, a company must pay for rent, salaries for employees, electricity bill, etc.
    # Variable costs are costs that vary directly with the level of production. eg, raw materials, packaging materials, transportation, etc
- Total cost = Fixed + Variable costs 
- Average cost = Total cost / Number of units, is the cost per unit at that level of production
- Break Even refers to the revenues needed to cover a company's total expenses
- Break-even point (BEP) is the point at which costs and revenue are equal. At this point there is no loss or no gain
- Break even calculation, total fixed costs: ₹500,000, variable costs per unit: ₹300, sale price per unit: ₹500
    # Break-even unit volume = Fixed Costs/(SP per unit – VC per unit) ie, ₹500,000/(₹500 – ₹300) = 2,500 units
    # Break-even cost = Break-even unit volume * SP per unit ie, 2,500 units * ₹500 = ₹1,250,000
- Demand is a function of desire, ability, and willingness
    <img src="images/demand-formula.JPG" alt="" width="35%">
- Process of Price Setting
    # Decide the pricing objective(ലക്ഷ്യം) eg, maximising profits, increasing sales volume, matching competitors' prices, deterring competitors or just pure survival
    # Determining the demand(DTD) provides the base for setting a price ceiling(max amount allowed for a product or service)
    # Estimating all type of costs ie, fixed cost, variable cost and determine the per unit price (manufacturing cost +  marketing cost + profit)
    # Analyzing competitors’ costs, prices, and offers (determine pricing parameters of your competitors will help you to decide our own pricing)
    # Decide a pricing method, to set the specific price level that achieves companies goals and objectives, marketers make use of various pricing methods
        @ Markup pricing(producers prespective), adding a percentage to a cost to determine its selling price. Mark up price = unit cost / (1 – desired profit on sales)
        @ Target return pricing(producers prespective), expecting the return based on the investment. Unit cost + ((desired return * invested capital)/ unit sales)
        @ Perceived value pricing(consumers prespective), value which customers are willing to pay.
        @ Value pricing(consumers prespective), provide higher value to consumers ie, reducing price point, reorganize experience of shopping, etc. Few variants are 
            % loss leader pricing, reduce the price of grocery store staples (milk, meat, and eggs) to bare cost as loss leaders so customers might by other items
            % EDLP(every day low pricing), low price without the need to wait for sale price events or comparison shopping
        @ Going rate pricing(consumers prespective), follow the leader pricing method. New players will follow the leader since the price is pre-defined
        @ Sealed bid pricing(consumers prespective), B2B, tendering process
        @ Psychological pricing(consumers prespective), eg, bata pricing or high pricing to show quality
- Setting the Final Price 
        @ Company's pricing objectives
        @ Company's pricing policy
        @ Needs and wants of the target consumer
        @ Impact of other marketing activities ie, brand's quality, advertising related to the competition, etc
        @ Impact of price on the other parties like other stakeholders such as dealers, distributors, salesperson, suppliers
        @ Once the price is decided then review into these factors and say that whether the price is correct and then say, okay, this is done
<hr>
<b id="id_place_detail">Place</b> 
<img src="images/4Ps.jpeg" alt="" width="30%">
- Place means distribution channels, how the product will reach the customers (smooth flow of products)
- Distribution channels can be viewed as a set of interdependent organizations involved in the process of making a product or service available for consumption to the end consumer
- Independent organizations - who link manufacturer and consumer are called intermediaries, like distributors, dealers, wholesalers, retailers
    <img src="images/distribution-channel.JPG" alt="" width="50%">
- For a product to be successful, its very important that it is communicated in right Way, right Place, right Time and right People
- Benefits of distribution channels
    # Reaching customers easily
    # Increase in customer base
    # Less expenditure
    # Market Knowledge
    # Bridging the gaps
    # Improved Efficiency
    # Reaching to international customers
- Functions performed by the distribution channels/intermediaries
    # Buying, purchasing a broad assortment of items from the producer or other channel members

- Some of the channel members
    # Wholesalers
    # Distributors
    # Dealers
    # Company's own sales force
    # Retailers
- Wholesalers involves buying / procuring in bulk from the manufacturer and selling it to the next member (mostly retailer) in the distribution channel in their desired quantity
- Wholesalers is a commercial establishment that purchases in bulk from various manufacturers, stocks the items then offers complete assortment of the specified merchandise for resale to the retail stores
- 6 types of wholesalers
    # Merchant wholesalers, buy and own the product, store and sell to the customer(any channel). eg, FMCG industry, agriculture industry
    # Full service wholesaler(distributor), giving full service(order picking, delivery, training sales associates, promotions) to the end retailer except product service 
    # Limited service wholesaler, stocks the products and sells it in a limited channel. eg, exclusive online wholesaler, cash and carry wholesalers and logistics wholesalers(milk wholesalers)
    # Agent and Broker, help in striking a deal, and pocket their fees. Agent is long-term (insurance) and Broker is short-term (real estate)
    # Manufacturer's own sales force or branch offices
    # Specialized wholesalers. eg, A used car wholesaler
- Business activities of retailers involved in selling goods and services to the final consumer for their personal or household use
- Retailers procure merchandise from the manufacturer or wholesaler in bulk and sell it to the end consumer in smaller quantities
- Characterics of retailing 
    # Like large number of transactions
    # Less margin for transactions
    # Average size of transactions is quite less
- Retailing in emerging economies is divided into two distinct categories
    # Traditional or unorganized sector
    # Modern or organized sector
- 5 types of retail formats
    # Department store, a large shop stocking products in different departments. Customer services available. eg, MAX, splash, lifestyle, Carrefour

    # Supermarket, a large self-service shop selling foods and household goods, aim to meet all their consumer's weekly needs. Customer services not available. eg, Big Bazaar, Reliance Fresh
- Distribution channel level, the number of intermediaries between the producer and the consumer. 
    # Direct marketing channel (0 level), it does not have any intermediaries, goods directly go from the manufacturer to the customer eg, personal selling, telemarketing, manufacturers' own stores, or B2B
    # Indirect marketing channel, we have multiple levels
        @ 1 level, only one intermediary namely retailer. Manufacturer to retailer to the end consumer        
        @ 2 level, manufacturer to wholesaler to retailer to end consumer        
        @ 3 level, manufacturer to distributor to wholesaler to retailer to end consumer. Distributors are attached to the manufacturer where a wholesaler can carry products of different manufacturers
        <img src="images/all-level-distribution-channel.JPG" alt="" srcset="" width="42%">
- Industrial products mostly use direct marketing channel
- Consumer products use indirect marketing channel for reaching mass base of consumers and more penetration
- 3 distinct types of distribution systems to choose from
    # Intensive — maximum coverage through all possible outlets. As many distributors, dealers, wholesalers, retailers engaged with all of them and try to reach as many consumers through as many outlets
    # Selective — limited number of outlets in specific geographic areas target consumers
    # Exclusive — only one channel member, it could be a distributor, it could be a wholesaler, it could be retailer
- Systematic approach for designing channels involves the following steps
    # Establishing the channel objectives ie, profit, growth, market share, ROI
    # Analysis of consumer's desired service and output levels, ie, closer interaction with manufacurer and consumer for specific information sharing & no interaction required like FMCG kind of products
    # Identify major channel alternatives available in the geographic location like online channels, the distributors, dealers, wholesalers, retailers, and companies' own sales forces 
    <img src="images/channel-alternative-1.JPG" alt="" width="18%"> <img src="images/channel-alternative-2.JPG" alt="" width="15%">
