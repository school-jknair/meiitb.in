<b>How to market a product</b>  
- Breaking the market into segments 
- Selecting the target segment(one specific segment or two-three segments)
- Designing a set of meaningful differences to distinguish the company’s offerings from competitor’s offerings
- Create a positive image in the mind of the target consumer to maximize the potential benefit to the firm

<b>Segmentation</b>
- The process of dividing the market into various homogeneous groups based on some common parameters is called 'Segmentation'

- Segmentation based on the internal self of consumers is known as psychographic segmentation
- While demographics provides the marketer with the 'who' aspect, psychographics provides the 'why' aspect
- Behavioral segmentation divides a population based on their behaviour, with respect to their purchase and usage of the products

<b>Targeting</b>
- Targeting means selecting one or more identified segments and concentrating on those segments rather than the whole market
- The criteria for selecting target market are: segment's size and growth, segment’s structural attractiveness and organization’s objectives and resources
- The various targeting strategies are as follows: single segment concentration, selective specialization, product specialization, market specialization and whole market coverage

<b>Differentiation</b>
- Differentiation is the act of designing a set of meaningful differences to distinguish the company’s offerings from competitor’s offerings.
- Undifferentiated marketing assumes the lack of significant differences among the consumers and their requirements.
- A niche market is the subset of an identified segment on which a specific product is focused. 
- Differentiation Parameters include product differentiation, service differentiation, personnel differentiation and differentiation based on channel and imagery.
- A ‘Competitor’ is anyone who provides the same offering to the same target segment. 
- Types of competition include brand level, industry level, form level and generic level competition.

- Positioning means creating a positive image in the minds of consumers.
- Deciding on a positioning requires:

    (2) Identifying the optimal points of parity and points of difference ie similarity and dissimilarities
    (3) Creating a brand mantra to summarize the positioning and essence of the brand
