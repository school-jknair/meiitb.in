A <b>marketing strategy</b> refers to a business's overall game plan for reaching prospective consumers and turning them into customers of their products or services

<b>Basic building blocks of marketing strategy</b> 
- divides the market into various homogeneous groups based on some common parameters through segmentation
- oranization 'targets' a market by selecting one or more identified segments and concentrating on those segments
- distinguish company’s offerings from competitor’s offerings through differentiation
- create a positive image in the minds of consumers through positioning.
<hr>
<b>Segmentation</b>
- The process of dividing the market into various homogeneous groups based on some common parameters is called 'Segmentation'
- Fundamental "bases for segmentation" of consumer market. They are as follows, 
    1.geographic(what) ie, region, city size, density of population, climate
    2.demographic(who) ie, births, deaths, marriages, age, income, education, occupation
    3.psychographic(why) its psychology+demography ie, lifestyle, their activities, interests, personality, likes and dislikes etc
    4.behavioral(how) ie, customers approach to making purchase decision and usage of the product or service
- The term 'demographics' indicates vital and measurable statistics of human population. ie, age, gender, marital status, education, occupation, income and family size
- Segmentation based on the internal self of consumers is known as psychographic segmentation
- Behavioral segmentation divides a population based on their behaviour and these behaviour can be categorized based on
    1.needs and benefits, eg: in case of pad locks, jewellery safety is the need and jewellery worth is the benefit
    2.decision roles 
        <img src="images/decision-roles.JPG" width="20%">
    3.user and usage pattern, (existing customer only)
        #user status
            <img src="images/user-non-user.JPG" width="8%">
        #buyer readiness
            <img src="images/buyer-readiness-stages.JPG" width="55%">
        #usage rate
            @heavy user, somebody uses shampoo two times or three times a day
            @light user, somebody uses shampoo once a week
        #loyalty status, loyalty a strong feeling of support or allegiance to a brand
            @hard-core loyals, who buy the same brand all the time. IT companies like Apple or Google have many loyal customers.
            @split loyals, split between 2 or 3 brands. These type of customers do not go crazy for one brand only they are OK with 2-3 brands(OK to travel with both Cox & Kings or Thomas cook)
            @shifting loyals, shift between 10 or more brands. However, shifting loyals is less loyal than split loyals
            @switchers, with no loyalty. Keep switching even when they liked a brand this is because they want to experience new things
        #purchase occasion, ie, special occasion like festivals or office party or your regular purchase

<b>Targeting</b>
- Targeting means selecting one or more identified segments and concentrating on those segments rather than the whole market
- The criteria for selecting the target market/s are 
    1.segment's size and growth
    2.segment’s structural attractiveness - Number of competitors, Entry barriers(need government permissions, patents), Exit barrier(lot of fixed assets, lot of customers)
    3.organization’s objectives and resources
- The various targeting strategies are 
    1.single segment concentration
    2.selective specialization
    3.product specialization
    4.market specialization 
    5.whole market coverage

<u>Example for Targeting Strategies</u>, 
A hypothetical company which has 3 product lines(cosmetics, apparels, shoes), bases of segmentation is age & gender , 3 targeted segments - female teens(13-19), ladies of adults(25-35) and elders(more than 50)

<b>Differentiation</b>
- Differentiation is the act of designing a set of meaningful differences to distinguish the company’s offerings from competitor’s offerings.
- Undifferentiated marketing assumes the lack of significant differences among the consumers and their requirements.
- A niche market is the subset of an identified segment on which a specific product is focused. 
- Differentiation Parameters include 
    1.product differentiation based on the product attributes like forms(physical structure), feature, performance, conformance, durability, reliability, repairability, style/design
    2.service differentiation like ordering ease, delivery, installation, customer training, customer consulting, maintenance and repair
    3.personnel differentiation like competence (കഴിവ്), courtesy (മര്യാദ), credibility (വിശ്വാസയോഗ്യമായ), reliability (വിശ്വാസയോഗ്യമായ), responsiveness (പ്രതികരണം), effective communication
    4.channel and imagery differentiation
- A ‘Competitor’ is anyone who provides the same offering to the same target segment. 
- Types of competition include 
    1.brand level, COKE and PEPSI
    2.industry level, aerated drinks industry
    3.form level, drinks industry
    4.generic level, all available products for the same price point
<hr>
<b>Positioning</b>
- Positioning means creating a positive image in the minds of consumers.
- Deciding on a positioning requires
    1.determining a frame of reference, Apple understood that using the old dump land phone as a frame of reference made the device instantly familiar to the masses
    2.identifying the optimal points of parity(POP) and points of difference(POD) ie similarity and dissimilarities
    3.creating a brand mantra to summarize the positioning and essence of the brand
<hr>
<b>4Ps</b> are the tools for marketing strategy otherwise known as marketing mix
- Product

<b>Product</b> 
- A product is anything that can be offered to the market to satisfy a need or want. eg, Goods, Services, Events, Experiences, Persons, Places, Properties, Organizations, Information, Ideas
- A product can be visualized in multiple levels. The levels are: Core level, Basic Product, Expected Product, Augmented Product and Potential Product.
    1 core benefit of a hotel is to provide a place to rest or sleep when away from home
    2 basic benefits in hotel room includes a bed, a bathroom, towel, desk, etc. Basic products through which the core benefit is delivered
    3 expected product is the set of attributes that the consumers normally expect when they buy the product like a fresh towel, clean bed, new soap,a fan and whatever when they book a hotel room
    4 augmented product the one in which exceeds customer expectation which leads to happiness or customer delight like free dinner, a mini bar. Expected & Augmented depends on what the market is offering
    5 potential product covers all possible augmentations and all possible transformations that a product may go through in future leads to customer delight. Like complimentary spa treatment, all wines etc
    <img src="images/depiction-of-product-levels.JPG" alt="" width="12%">
- Consumer products are generally classified into four types those are convenience goods, shopping goods, specialty goods and unsought goods
    1 convenience goods are just buy based on their convenience ie without any significant decision making or thought process. eg, soft drinks, soap. These kind of products are further classified into 
        # staples, consumer purchases regularly, eg, commodity goods(grains, oil, and natural gas), toothpaste or soap
        # impulse, purchased without prior planning, eg, suddenly you see an ice-cream cone and buy it, suddenly, you see some chocolate and buy it

    4 unsought goods, people don't look forward to buy in this product. eg, fire extinguishers, fire alarms, any life insurance products
    <img src="images/consumer-products-classification.JPG" alt="" width="25%">
- Product line is a group of products that are closely related (satisfy similar type of needs, sold to same customer group and marketed through similar channels). eg, soaps (bar soaps and liquid soaps)
- The length of a product line refers to the total number of items that are there in a product line, length of soap product line is 2
- A product mix is also called product assortment, which is the set of all products of different product lines and items a particular seller offers for sale.
- eg, 1 product mix and 3 different product lines - soaps (bar soaps and liquid soaps), shampoos (anti-dandruff, hair fall control and hair growth), toothpastes (gel, regular, herbal, and toothpaste for kids)
- A product mix for any organization has got 4 properties: Length, Breadth, Depth and Consistency.

    # breadth or width of a product mix refers number of product lines. eg, breadth is 3 for the above example
    # depth refers to the number of product variation. eg, depth is 2 for above example
    # consistency of a product lines refers, if distribution of 2 product lines are on the same channel then consistent on the distribution channel and if same raw material then consistent on raw material 
    <img src="images/product-mix-properties.JPG" alt="" width="45%"> 
- Product Line Analysis steps
    # Understand each product lines market profile and performance.
        @ spreading the total product mix
        @ pull out the sales and profitability reports
        @ Analyze the reports
    # Review how the line is positioned against competitors lines
- Decision making by product managers after the analysis
    # Drop some items that are not doing well
    # Put more resources to the items that are performing better
    # Introduce new items if there are gaps in the market
- Through this analysis and elaboration we will develop a product mix that satisfies the needs and wants of our target consumer
- Brands is defined as a name, term, sign, symbol, design or combination of them, intended to identify the goods and services of one seller or group of sellers and differentiate them from competitors.
- Brand related decisions include: brand sponsor decision, brand name decision and brand strategy decision.

<b>Price</b>
- The objective of pricing decision is to determine the adequate price for any product or service. For companies, it provides revenue; and for consumers, it is the cost.
- Price should cover manufacturing cost +  marketing cost + profit desired by the company
- A graph for quantity demanded vs price is called the demand curve
    <img src="images/demand-curve.JPG" alt="" width="25%">
- Elasticity of Demand refers to the change of demand for every change of price 
- Elastic demand means a significant change in quantity demanded when the small price gets changed
- Inelastic demand means the slight or no change in quantity demanded when the price gets changed (either reduced or increased)
- Different types of costs
    # Fixed costs are costs that do not change with increase or decrease in production level or sales revenue. eg, a company must pay for rent, salaries for employees, electricity bill, etc.
    # Variable costs are costs that vary directly with the level of production. eg, raw materials, packaging materials, transportation, etc
- Total cost = Fixed + Variable costs 
- Average cost is the cost per unit at that level of production; Total cost/ Number of units from production
- Break Even refers to the revenues needed to cover a company's total expenses
- Break-even point (BEP) is the point at which costs and revenue are equal. At this point there is no loss or no gain
- Break even calculation
    # Total fixed costs: ₹500,000, Variable costs per unit: ₹300, Sale price per unit: ₹500
    # Break-even Unit Volume = Fixed Costs/(SP per Unit – VC per unit) ie, Break-even Unit Volume = 500,000/ (500 – 300) = 2,500 units to cover the costs or reach break even point
    # 2,500 units x ₹500 = ₹1,250,000 of total sales to cover the costs or reach break even point or before any profits are realized
- Process of Price Setting
    # Selecting the pricing objective(ലക്ഷ്യം) eg, maximising profits, increasing sales volume, matching competitors' prices, deterring competitors or just pure survival
    # Determining the demand(DTD). Demand is a function of desire, ability, and willingness. DTD is the base for setting a price ceiling ie, the maximum amount is allowed to charge for a product or service
    <img src="images/demand-formula.JPG" alt="" width="35%">
    # Estimating costs
    # Analyzing competitors’ costs, prices, and offers
    # Selecting a pricing method
    # Setting the final price
