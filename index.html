<b>Types of Markets</b>
- consumer market, own consumption by the consumer
- business market, output consumed by another industry, purchases in bulk for profit
- institutional market, consumed by an institution, purchases in bulk for non profit

A <b>marketing strategy</b> refers to a business's overall game plan for reaching prospective consumers and turning them into customers of their products or services

<b>Basic building blocks of marketing strategy</b> 
- divides the market into various homogeneous groups based on some common parameters through segmentation
- oranization 'targets' a market by selecting one or more identified segments and concentrating on those segments
- distinguish company’s offerings from competitor’s offerings through differentiation
- create a positive image in the minds of consumers through positioning.
<hr>
<b>Segmentation</b>
- The process of dividing the market into various homogeneous groups based on some common parameters is called 'Segmentation'
- Fundamental "bases for segmentation" of consumer market. They are as follows, 
    1.geographic(what) ie, region, city size, density of population, climate
    2.demographic(who) ie, births, deaths, marriages, age, income, education, occupation
    3.psychographic(why) its psychology+demography ie, lifestyle, their activities, interests, personality, likes and dislikes etc
    4.behavioral(how) ie, customers approach to making purchase decision and usage of the product or service
- The term 'demographics' indicates vital and measurable statistics of human population. ie, age, gender, marital status, education, occupation, income and family size
- Segmentation based on the internal self of consumers is known as psychographic segmentation
- Behavioral segmentation divides a population based on their behaviour and these behaviour can be categorized based on
    1.needs and benefits, eg: in case of pad locks, jewellery safety is the need and jewellery worth is the benefit
    2.decision roles 
        <img src="images/decision-roles.JPG" width="20%">
    3.user and usage pattern, (existing customer only)
        #user status
            <img src="images/user-non-user.JPG" width="8%">
        #buyer readiness
            <img src="images/buyer-readiness-stages.JPG" width="55%">
        #usage rate
            @heavy user, somebody uses shampoo two times or three times a day
            @light user, somebody uses shampoo once a week
        #loyalty status, loyalty a strong feeling of support or allegiance to a brand
            @hard-core loyals, who buy the same brand all the time. IT companies like Apple or Google have many loyal customers.
            @split loyals, split between 2 or 3 brands. These type of customers do not go crazy for one brand only they are OK with 2-3 brands(OK to travel with both Cox & Kings or Thomas cook)
            @shifting loyals, shift between 10 or more brands. However, shifting loyals is less loyal than split loyals
            @switchers, with no loyalty. Keep switching even when they liked a brand this is because they want to experience new things
        #purchase occasion, ie, special occasion like festivals or office party or your regular purchase
<hr>
<b>Targeting</b>
- Targeting means selecting one or more identified segments and concentrating on those segments rather than the whole market
- The criteria for selecting the target market/s are 
    1.segment's size and growth
    2.segment’s structural attractiveness - Number of competitors, Entry barriers(need government permissions, patents), Exit barrier(lot of fixed assets, lot of customers)
    3.organization’s objectives and resources
- The various targeting strategies are 
    1.single segment concentration
    2.selective specialization
    3.product specialization
    4.market specialization 
    5.whole market coverage

<u>Example for Targeting Strategies</u>, 
A hypothetical company which has 3 product lines(cosmetics, apparels, shoes), bases of segmentation is age & gender , 3 targeted segments - female teens(13-19), ladies of adults(25-35) and elders(more than 50)

<hr>
<b>Differentiation</b>
- Differentiation is the act of designing a set of meaningful differences to distinguish the company’s offerings from competitor’s offerings.
- Undifferentiated marketing assumes the lack of significant differences among the consumers and their requirements.
- A niche market is the subset of an identified segment on which a specific product is focused. 
- Differentiation Parameters include 
    1.product differentiation based on the product attributes like forms(physical structure), feature, performance, conformance, durability, reliability, repairability, style/design
    2.service differentiation like ordering ease, delivery, installation, customer training, customer consulting, maintenance and repair
    3.personnel differentiation like competence (കഴിവ്), courtesy (മര്യാദ), credibility (വിശ്വാസയോഗ്യമായ), reliability (വിശ്വാസയോഗ്യമായ), responsiveness (പ്രതികരണം), effective communication
    4.channel and imagery differentiation
- A ‘Competitor’ is anyone who provides the same offering to the same target segment. 
- Types of competition include 
    1.brand level, COKE and PEPSI
    2.industry level, aerated drinks industry
    3.form level, drinks industry
    4.generic level, all available products for the same price point
<hr>
<b>Positioning</b>
- Positioning means creating a positive image in the minds of consumers.
- Deciding on a positioning requires
    1.determining a frame of reference, Apple understood that using the old dump land phone as a frame of reference made the device instantly familiar to the masses
    2.identifying the optimal points of parity(POP) and points of difference(POD) ie similarity and dissimilarities
    3.creating a brand mantra to summarize the positioning and essence of the brand
<hr>

<img src="images/4Ps.jpeg" alt="" width="35%">

<b>Product</b> 
- A product is anything that can be offered to the market to satisfy a need or want. eg, [GOPI PEE & SPIt]
- Customers will choose a product based on their perceived(ഗ്രഹിക്കുക) value. A product can be categorized in multiple levels
    1 core, core benefit of a hotel is to provide a place to rest or sleep when away from home
    2 basic or generic product, basic benefits in hotel room includes a bed, a bathroom, towel, desk, etc. Basic products through which the core benefit is delivered

    5 potential product, covers all possible augmentations and all possible transformations that a product may go through in future leads to customer delight. Like complimentary spa treatment, all wines etc
    <img src="images/depiction-of-product-levels.JPG" alt="" width="12%">
- Consumer products are generally classified into four types those are convenience goods, shopping goods, specialty goods and unsought goods
    1 convenience goods are just buy based on their convenience ie without any significant decision making or thought process. eg, soft drinks, soap. These kind of products are further classified into 
        # staples, consumer purchases regularly, eg, commodity goods(grains, oil, and natural gas), toothpaste or soap
        # impulse, purchased without prior planning, eg, suddenly you see an ice-cream cone and buy it, suddenly, you see some chocolate and buy it
        # emergency goods, forced to buy such product due to emergency situation, eg, burnt your hand, and buy an antiseptic cream like Burnol
    2 shopping goods, consumer shops around and compares on brands, price, suitability, style, quality, for example, electrical appliances, furnitures, clothing
    3 specialty goods, goods with unique characteristics or unique brand appeal that is not replaceable like high priced luxury cars or like low priced Heinz Ketchup
    4 unsought goods, people don't look forward to buy in this product. eg, fire extinguishers, fire alarms, any life insurance products
    <img src="images/consumer-products-classification.JPG" alt="" width="25%">
- Product line is a group of products that are closely related (satisfy similar type of needs, sold to same customer group and marketed through similar channels). eg, soaps (bar soaps and liquid soaps)
- A product line is one line/group of similar products that are sold within a company
- A product mix is the combined total of all the product lines sold in a company is also called product assortment
<img src="images/product-mix-properties.JPG" alt="" width="35%"> 
- eg, 1 product mix and 3 different product lines - soaps (bar soaps and liquid soaps), shampoos (anti-dandruff, hair fall control and hair growth), toothpastes (gel, regular, herbal, and toothpaste for kids)
- A product line for any organization has got 2 properties
    # length is total products in that line
    # depth is total number of variants of each product offered in this line, variants include size, colour, flavours,
- A product mix for any organization has got 4 properties
    # length is total products in the product mix
    # breadth or width(വീതി) is number of product lines in the product mix
    # depth is total number of variants of each product offered in each line, variants include size, colour, flavours,
    # consistency is relationship, if distribution of 2 product lines are on the same channel then consistent on the distribution channel and if same raw material then consistent on raw material 
- Product Line Analysis steps
    # Understand each product lines market profile and performance.
        @ spreading the total product mix
        @ pull out the sales and profitability reports
        @ Analyze the reports
    # Review how the line is positioned against competitors lines
- Marketing managers will take product mix decision after the analysis to expanding the business and to increase the profitability

    # adding a new or eliminating any existing product from the product mix
    # adding a new product line
    # lengthening an existing line
    # bringing new variants of a brand
- Product Market Mix Strategy
    # small companies usually start out with a product mix limited in width, depth and length; and have a high level of consistency
    # however, over time, the company may want to differentiate products or acquire new ones to enter new markets by stretching the product line 
        @ upward stretching, add higher quality, more expensive products
        @ downward stretching, add lesser quality, lower priced products

<hr>
<b>Price</b>
- Objective - determine the adequate price for any product or service (pricing decision)
- For companies, it provides revenue; and for consumers, it is the cost
- A graph for quantity demanded vs price is called the demand curve
    <img src="images/demand-curve.JPG" alt="" width="25%">
- Elasticity of Demand refers to the change of demand for every change of price 
- Elastic demand means a significant change in quantity demanded when the small price gets changed
- Inelastic demand means the slight or no change in quantity demanded when the price gets changed (either reduced or increased)
- Different types of costs
    # Fixed costs are costs that do not change with increase or decrease in production level or sales revenue. eg, a company must pay for rent, salaries for employees, electricity bill, etc.
    # Variable costs are costs that vary directly with the level of production. eg, raw materials, packaging materials, transportation, etc
- Total cost = Fixed + Variable costs 
- Average cost = Total cost / Number of units, is the cost per unit at that level of production
- Break Even refers to the revenues needed to cover a company's total expenses
- Break-even point (BEP) is the point at which costs and revenue are equal. At this point there is no loss or no gain
- Break even calculation
    # Total fixed costs: ₹500,000, Variable costs per unit: ₹300, Sale price per unit: ₹500
    # Break-even Unit Volume = Fixed Costs/(SP per Unit – VC per unit) ie, Break-even Unit Volume = 500,000/ (500 – 300) = 2,500 units to cover the costs or reach break even point
    # 2,500 units x ₹500 = ₹1,250,000 of total sales to cover the costs or reach break even point or before any profits are realized
- Process of Price Setting
    # Decide the pricing objective(ലക്ഷ്യം) eg, maximising profits, increasing sales volume, matching competitors' prices, deterring competitors or just pure survival
    # Determining the demand(DTD) provides the base for setting a price ceiling(max amount allowed for a product or service). Demand is a function of desire, ability, and willingness
    <img src="images/demand-formula.JPG" alt="" width="35%">
    # Estimating costs provides base for price setting
        @ identify the types of costs (fixed cost and variable cost)
        @ determine the per unit cost of your product (price should cover manufacturing cost +  marketing cost + profit desired by the company)
    # Analyzing competitors’ costs, prices, and offers (determine pricing parameters of your competitors will help you to decide our own pricing)
    # Decide a pricing method, to set the specific price level that achieves companies goals and objectives, marketers make use of various pricing methods
        @ Pricing based on producers prespective
            $ Markup Pricing, adding a percentage to a cost to determine its selling price. Mark up price = unit cost / (1 – desired profit on sales)
            $ Target return Pricing, expecting the return based on the investment. Unit cost + ((desired return * invested capital)/ unit sales)
        @ pricing based on consumers  prespective
            $ Perceived value pricing, value which customers are willing to pay.
            $ Value pricing, provide higher value to consumers ie, reducing price point, reorganize experience of shopping, etc. Few variants are 
                % loss leader pricing, reduce the price of grocery store staples (milk, meat, and eggs) to bare cost as loss leaders so customers might by other items
                % EDLP(every day low pricing), low price without the need to wait for sale price events or comparison shopping
            $ Going rate pricing, follow the leader pricing method. New players will follow the leader since the price is pre-defined
            $ Sealed bid pricing, B2B, tendering process
            $ Psychological pricing, eg, bata pricing or high pricing to show quality
    # Setting the Final Price 
        @ company's pricing objectives
        @ company's pricing policy
        @ needs and wants of the target consumer
        @ impact of other marketing activities ie, brand's quality, advertising related to the competition, etc
        @ impact of price on the other parties like other stakeholders such as dealers, distributors, salesperson, suppliers
        @ once the price is decided then review into these factors and say that whether the price is correct and then say, okay, this is done
<hr>

<b>Place</b> 
- Place means distribution channels, how the product will reach the customers (smooth flow of products)
- Distribution channels can be viewed as a set of interdependent organizations involved in the process of making a product or service available for consumption to the end consumer
- Independent organizations - who link manufacturer and consumer are called intermediaries, like distributors, dealers, wholesalers, retailers
<img src="images/distribution-channel.JPG" alt="" width="50%">
- For a product to be successful, its very important that it is communicated in right Way, right Place, right Time and right People
- Benefits of distribution channels
    # Reaching customers easily
    # Increase in customer base
    # Less expenditure
    # Market Knowledge
    # Bridging the gaps
    # Improved Efficiency
    # Reaching to international customers
- Functions performed by the distribution channels/intermediaries
    # Buying, purchasing a broad assortment of items from the producer or other channel members
    # Storage and Carrying inventory
    # Selling, selling goods to consumers or other channel members

- Some of the channel members
    # Wholesalers
    # Distributors
    # Dealers
    # Company's own sales force
    # Retailers
- Wholesalers
- It involves buying / procuring in bulk from the manufacturer and selling it to the next member (mostly retailer) in the distribution channel in their desired quantity
- It is a commercial establishment that purchases in bulk from various manufacturers, stocks the items then offers complete assortment of the specified merchandise for resale to the retail stores
- It may be differentiated into various categories based on the functions carried out by them
    # Merchant, who takes title of the merchandise procured, buys the items from the manufacturer
        @ Full function wholesaler, provides a full set of functions 
        @ Limited service wholesaler, provides only part of functions
    # Agent, do not take title or ownership. They are primarily involved in making the buying and selling parties meet, help in striking a deal, and pocket their fees
    # Manufacturer's own sales force or branch offices, these offices usually carry little inventory and primarily take orders for the merchandise, either full or limited service provideres
- Retailers
- Business activities involved in selling goods and services to the final consumer for their personal or household use
- Procured the merchandise from the manufacturer or wholesaler in bulk and sell it to the end consumer in smaller quantities
- Characterics of retailing 
    # like large number of transactions
    # less margin for transactions
    # average size of transactions is quite less
- Retailing in emerging economies is divided into two distinct categories
    # traditional or unorganized sector
    # modern or organized sector
- Types of Retail Formats
    # Department store, offer a product range that is both wide(breadth) and deep(depth) eg, MAX, splash, lifestyle
    # Discount store, high volume stores with low price eg, Walmart and Kmart
    # Specialty stores, concentrate on one type of merchandise and offer in a manner that makes it special (have narrow product line) eg, Body shop, iStore
    # Supermarket, these are large, low-cost, low-margin, high-volume, self-service stores designed to meet total needs for household products. eg, Big Bazaar, Reliance Fresh
    # ‘Mom and Pop’ and ‘Kirana’ stores, these are traditional independent convenience stores. Each of the Kirana store cater to mostly local population (maximum 1 km radius) in unorganized sector
- Distribution 
- Channel level, the number of intermediaries between the producer and the consumer. 
    # Direct marketing channel (0 level), it does not have any intermediaries, goods directly go from the manufacturer to the customer eg, personal selling, telemarketing, manufacturers' own stores, or B2B
    # Indirect marketing channel, we have multiple levels
        @ 1 level, only one intermediary namely retailer. Manufacturer to retailer to the end consumer        
        @ 2 level, manufacturer to wholesaler to retailer to end consumer        
        @ 3 level, manufacturer to distributor to wholesaler to retailer to end consumer. Distributors are attached to the manufacturer where a wholesaler can carry products of different manufacturers
        <img src="images/all-level-distribution-channel.JPG" alt="" srcset="" width="42%">
- Type of market for serving
    # industrial products use direct marketing channel
    # consumer products use indirect marketing channel for reaching mass base of consumers and more penetration
- 3 distinct types of distribution systems to choose from
    # Intensive—maximum coverage through all possible outlets. As many distributors, dealers, wholesalers, retailers engaged with all of them and try to reach as many consumers through as many outlets
    # Selective—limited number of outlets in specific geographic areas target consumers
    # Exclusive—only one channel member, it could be a distributor, it could be a wholesaler, it could be retailer
- Design a channel for smooth flow of products either developing a new marketing channels or modify existing channel
- Systematic approach for designing involves the following steps:
    # Analysis of consumer's desired service and output levels
        @ Closer interaction with manufacurer and consumer for specific knowledge, specific audio requirements, specific video requirements, computer systems
        @ No interaction required like regular FMCG kind of products
    # Establishing the channel objectives 
        @ Profit 
        @ Growth
        @ Market share
        @ ROI
    # Identify major channel alternatives available in the geographic location like online channels, the distributors, dealers, wholesalers, retailers, and companies' own sales forces 
    <img src="images/channel-alternative-1.JPG" alt="" width="18%"> <img src="images/channel-alternative-2.JPG" alt="" width="15%">
