        <a href="#w1" id="w1_details" style="color: black; text-decoration: none;"><b>Week 1 : What is Marketing</b></a>
            <b>Marketing definition by Kotler</b> : Marketing is a societal process by which individuals and groups obtain what they need and want by creating, 
            offering and freely exchanging products and services of value with others           
            1. <b>Societal Process</b>, A society survives by consuming (food,electronics, vehicle). Seller <u>supply</u> the goods for consuming. Marketing in 
            a way its helping the society so its defined as societal process 
            2. Customers have their requirements(<b>Needs and Wants</b>).  
            Need: feeling of not having some basic necessities (Hunger). It's an emotional thing 
            Want: satisfy your need (Pizza/Rice). it's a material
            3. <b>Individuals and Groups</b>, Individuals having individuality and groups have collective individuality similarly the need and want will be different
            4. <b>Creating, Offering and Freely Exchanging</b>
            <u>Creating</u> if the customer requirement is not available, then this needs to be created like (iPhone with UPI option). Procuerment is in a way it's 
            creating.
            <u>Offering</u> informing the customer about the creation(product), where it is available(store,web) at what price(price tag). Offering includes 
            Product,Price,Place and Promotion.
            <u>Freely Exchanging</u> seller and customer should have alternatives to do the exchanging.
            5. <b>Products and Services</b> anything that satisfies your needs. the <b>WANT</b> part. Product is tangible and service is intangible. 
            The exchange will happen only <u>when the total utility is the more than the total cost</u>
            What is total utility? Total utility is the aggregate amount of satisfaction or fulfillment that a consumer receives through the consumption of a 
            specific good or service.        
            <u>TU = U1 + MU2 + MU3</u> in this (TU = Total Utility, U = Utility, MU = Marginal Utility) 
            Utility = machine, Concenience = opportunity to avoid physical exertion, Tangible cost = cost of goods, Intangible cost = time + energy + resources spend 
            to finally decide the product
            <b>Marketing</b>
            - helps in introducing new products that eases or enriches people’s lives
            - creates new opportunities in the market where ever there is any shortcomings or necessity
            - helps in creating demand for products and services, which, in turn, creates jobs
            - contributes in improving the economic condition of lower level of society by converting social issue into a business opportunity thereby creating 
            win-win situation to both organisations and the society          
            <b>Marketing management art or science</b>
            Why <u>art</u>, it is this <b>intuition</b> combined with <b>imagination, motivation and practice</b> that makes marketing management possible. 
            Why science, relies on data and numbers to arrive at workable decisions, choosing the merchandise daily and price fixation are part of science. 
            <b>Marketing management from an organizational view point</b>
            Marketing is the process of <b>planning and executing</b> the conception, pricing, promotion and distribution of 
            idea, goods and services to create <b>exchanges</b> that satisfy individual and organizational goals.
            <b>View point difference on definition</b>
            Kotler's definition is only from a customer view point 
            Organizational definition is from consumer and organizational point of view.  
            <b>Entities that can be marketed</b>
            - Goods
            - Services
            - Events
            - Experiences
            - Persons
            - Places
            - Properties
            - Organizations
            - information
            - Ideas   
            <b>Types of Markets</b>
            - Consumer market, The products that is used by the consumer for their own consumption
            - Business market, The purchase is bulk, output of one firm goes either as raw material or as processed or consumable goods into another industry. 
            Buyers buy goods to resell at some other point of time for profit
            - Institutional market, The purchase is bulk, but it is not for any profit motive or not for reselling. For example, hotels, schools, universities etc
            <b>Difference</b>
            - Marketing - starts from the customer (Eureka Fobes comes to customer)
            - Selling - starts from the manufacturer (tele-sales)  
            <u>Just an extra note</u>
            For a <b>product to be successful</b>, its very important that it is communicated in
            - right Way
            - right Place
            - right Time
            - right People         
            <b>What are the sellers duty ?</b>  
            - Buy the items according to the customer requirement 
            - Arrange those items in an attractive order
            - Wait for the customer visits
            
        <b><a href="#w2" id="w2_details" style="color: black; text-decoration: none;">Week 2 : Segmentation and Targeting</a></b>
            <b>Segmentation</b>, the process of dividing the market into various homogeneous(ഒരേ പോലെയായ) groups based on some common parameters is called 
            segmentation. Segmentation helped in identifying the potential customers.
            <b>Bases of Segmentation</b>, Set parameters to form a segmentation is called bases of segmentation.
            <b>Targeting</b>, Among the multiple segments, focusing on one or a few segments is called targeting. 
            <b>Differentiation</b>, How to differentiate your product from your competitor in the target segment. 
            <b>Positioning</b>, communicating your differentiation to the target market.
            <b>Segmentation exercise</b>
            first we need to identify the <b>differentiation</b> about the product. Based on this we need to create the <b>bases of segmentation</b> and subsequently 
            closing on to the <b>targetted segment</b>.
            <b>Different bases of segmentation</b>, marketing managers use certain <b>bases</b> to segment the market. 
            - Geographic Segmentation (ഭൂമിശാസ്ത്രപരമായ വിഭജനം), What aspect of customers, places where the consumer stay (rural or urban). Region, city size, 
            density of population, climate
            - Demographic Segmentation (ജനസംഖ്യാപരമായ വിഭജനം), Who aspect of customers, vital and measurable statistics of human population. Vital(births, 
            deaths, fetal deaths, marriages) and measurable (age, income, education, occupation).
            - Psychographic Segmentation (മനഃശാസ്തപരമായ വിഭജനം), Why aspect of customers, psychology+demography to better understand customers (lifestyle, 
            their activities, interests, personality, likes and dislikes etc).
            - Behavioral Segmentation (പെരുമാറ്റം വിഭജനം), How aspect of customers, behavior with respect to their purchase and usage of the products. 
                -- Needs and Benefits, what customers needs (in lock, its safety) and what are the benefits (jewelry) they can expect from the product.
                -- Decision roles, the roles the consumers play during the purchase decision, like <u>initiator, influencer, decider, buyer, and the user</u> .
                -- User and Usage pattern, (concerning existing customer base not new coustomer)
                   --- User status, either you are an user or you are an non user
                   --- Buyer readiness, different stages like 
                        ---- Not aware, not aware about the product
                        ---- Aware, aware about the product 
                        ---- Not informed, who is aware but <u>not formed an opinion</u> about the product
                        ---- Informed, aware and <u>formed an opinion</u> about the product 
                        ---- Not interested, informed but <u>not developed an interest</u> to buy the product
                        ---- Interested, developed an interest but <u>not enough intention to buy the product</u>
                        ---- Intention to buy, interested and <u>intends to buy</u>
                    --- Usage rate
                        ---- Heavy user, somebody uses shampoo two times or three times a day
                        ---- Light user, somebody uses shampoo once a week
                    --- Loyalty status, loyalty a strong feeling of support or allegiance to a brand
                        ---- Hard-core Loyals, who buy the same brand all the time
                        ---- Split Loyals, loyal to two or three brands
                        ---- Shifting Loyals, moving from one brand to another
                        ---- Switchers, with no loyalty
                    --- Purchase occasion, that is, special occasion like festivals or office party or your regular purchase
            <b>Another definition for bases for segmentation</b>
            - Demographics: Things like the age, gender, income, marital status, ethnicity, employment status, etc., of your buyers. 
            - Geographics: Where your customers are located (this can be as wide as entire continents, or even just a single neighborhood or street). 
            - Psychographics: What drives your customers? What are their likes and dislikes? What problems do they face in their lives? 
            Often we see products based on demography,
                - Harley Davidson for male
                - Hero Honda Pleasure for girls
                - TAG Heuer watches for affluent class
                - Colgate coming up with Spider man and Barbie toothpastes for boys and girls
                - Johnson baby oil for the kids
            One of the most popular commercially available classification system based on psychographic measurement is <b>Strategic Business Insight’s VALS framework</b>.
            VALS stands for Values And Lifestyle 
            framework. VALS classifies US adults into eight primary groups. 
                - Innovators - are those who are successful, sophisticated, active, take charge kind of people with high self-esteem
                - Thinkers - are mature, satisfied, and reflective people motivated by ideals, and who value order, knowledge, and responsibility. They seek durability, 
                functionality, and value in product
                - Achievers
                - Experiencers
                - Believers
                - Strivers
                - Makers
                - Survivors
            While their usage and application are quite intuitive
            <b>Education, Occupation, and Income </b>together are called the <b>triple indicators</b> of the lifestyle
            <b>Conditions for effective segmentation</b>
            - Total market should be heterogeneous(ഒരേ പോലെയല്ലാത്ത) and homogeneous(ഒരേ പോലെയായ) with in the identified segments
            - There should be enough potential customers in each of the identified segments
            - Customers within the segment should be willing and ability to buy the product
            - Marketers should be able communicate effectively with the target segment
            <b>Introduction to Targeting</b>
            <b>Targeting</b>? is a process of selecting the target segment(one specific segment or two-three segments). This target segment is most likely to want or need 
            a business's products or services
            <b>Target segment selection criteria</b>
            - Segment size and growth, these criteria is significant because it tells you how much of resources you need to invest and what is the return (5% or 10% market 
            share)
                -- <u>size</u> indicates the current size in terms of number of consumers in that segment
                -- <u>growth</u> in two years’ time, how these size is going to be grow  
            - Structural attractiveness
                --Number of competitors (less, it is attractive & more, it is not attractive)
                --Entry barriers, how easy it is to enter into the market ie, need government permissions, patents, R&D, huge investment for land, Huge investment for manpower
                --Exit barrier, how difficult it is to leave the market ie, lot of fixed assets(got land, got machinery, got industry), lot of customers who are looking 
                forward to you
            - Organization's own objectives and deployment of resources(man, machine, material, money) to make the process work
            Normally use the <b>Michael Porter's Five Force Analysis Model</b> for deciding the structural attractiveness
            - Threat of new entrants 
            - Threat of intense segment rivalry
            - Threat of substitute products
            - Bargaining power of the consumers(consumer market)/buyers(B2B market)
            - Bargaining power of the suppliers
            <b>Ideal market</b> for you to enter, threat of new entrant is less, threat of intense segment rivalry is less, threat of substitute products are not there, 
            bargaining power of buyer as well 
            as supplier is low
            <b>Targeting Strategies</b> 
            - <b>single segment concentration</b>, focusing on one segment; 
            - <b>selective specialization</b>, which means you are focusing on two or three segments which are apparently not related with each other; 
            - <b>product specialization</b>, one product satisfying all the different markets; 
            - <b>market specialization</b>, you are looking up to the needs and wants of one total market in different stages; 
            - <b>covering the whole market</b>
            <u>example</u>  
                hypothetical company which has 3 product lines
                    cosmetics
                    apparels
                    shoes
                segments
                    - teens(13-19), female
                    - adults(25-35), ladies
                    - elders(more than 50), ladies
                bases of segmentation 
                    - age (constant)
                    - gender (females)
                - single segment concentration
                    cosmetics for adult ladies which is <u>single segment concentration</u>
                - selective specialization 
                    cosmetics for adult ladies, apparels for the elder ladies, shoes for teens which is <u>selective specialization</u>
                - product specialization 
                    cosmetics for 3 different markets(teens, adult ladies, elder ladies) which is <u>product specialization</u>. Example for this strategy Lakme, Maybelline, 
                    and most life style products brands.
                - market specialization 
                    all products(cosmetics, apparels, shoes) only for adult ladies which is <u>market specialization</u>. Example for this strategy luxury products like Gucci, 
                    Prada, Pierre Cardin, Dolce & Gabbana.
                - full market coverage
                    same product I am offering to the whole market. products which is having monopoly and commodity products like milk,rice etc.
            <u>Just an extra note</u>
            Difference: a <b>commodity</b> is a raw material used in the production process to manufacture finished goods, while a <b>product</b> is a finished good sold to 
            consumers. No value is added to a commodity, which can be grown, extracted, or mined.

            <b>Summary</b> 
            - The process of dividing the market into various homogeneous groups based on some common parameters is called 'Segmentation'
            - There are four fundamental bases for segmentation of consumer market. They are as follows: (1) Geographic, (2) Demographic, (3) Psychographic and (3) Behavioral
            - The different geographic variables for segmenting consumers are as follows: region, city size, density of population and climate 
            - The term 'demographics' indicates vital and measurable statistics of human population
            - Some of the often-used demographic variables are as follows: age, gender, marital status, education, occupation, income and family size
            - Segmentation based on the internal self of consumers is known as psychographic segmentation
            - While demographics provides the marketer with the 'who' aspect, psychographics provides the 'why' aspect
            - Behavioral segmentation divides a population based on their behaviour, with respect to their purchase and usage of the products
            - Targeting means selecting one or more identified segments and concentrating on those segments rather than the whole market
            - The criteria for selecting target market are: segment's size and growth, segment’s structural attractiveness and organization’s objectives and resources
            - The various targeting strategies are as follows: single segment concentration, selective specialization, product specialization, market specialization and full 
            market coverage
        <b><a href="#w3" id="w2_details" style="color: black; text-decoration: none;">Week 3 : Differentiation and Positioning</a></b>    
            <b>Differentiation</b> It is the act of designing a set of meaningful differences to distinguish the company’s offerings from competitor’s offerings.  
            <b>Differentiated Marketing</b>, different strategy for every segment. The process of dividing the market into various homogenous groups, identifying the specific 
            requirements of the said homogenous groups and coming up with meaningful and distinct offering for each of the target groups is called differentiated marketing.
            <b>Undifferentiated Marketing</b> or mass marketing, one strategy for all segments. Assumes lack of significant differences among the consumers and develops one offering
            (4P - product, price, promotion, and place) for the whole market. For more than 90 years, Coca-cola offered only one product version to the whole market.
            <b>Niche Marketing</b>, identify a specific subset with in an segment called niche segment. The product will have its own specific needs, preferences, and identity. Most 
            luxury marketes are niche market     
            <u>Just an extra note</u>
                Satisfaction, is the main point the customer will consider most before buying a product
                ME-TOO kind of products, not having a good differentiation with other competitors.
                USP, unique selling proposition, defines all the logical reasons to buy. Example "you get fresh, hot pizza delivered to your door in 30 minutes or less or it's free".
                ESP, emotional selling proposition, defines all the emotional reasons to buy. Example "Gillette: The best a man can get"
            <b>Unique</b>, in a competitive market all the firms, needs to have an offering that is <u>unique – significantly different from others</u>. Otherwise, it will have one of 
            the “me-too” kind of products, suffer from consumer confusion and finally perish from the market. At one extreme, we have products that allow very little or no variation such 
            as salt, sugar, pulses, etc, (undifferentiated marketing or low differentiation). At the other extreme, we have products capable of high differentiation such as automobiles, 
            furnitures, mobile phones, etc. 
            <b>Identifing the differentiation and positioning the products</b>   
            <img src="images/differentiation2positioning.jpg" width="30%" alt="">
            <b>Differentiation parameters</b>        
            <u>Product differentiation</u>, how marketers can differentiate based on the product attributes
            - Forms like size, shape, colors, flavors and so on and so forth
            - Features like camera in a mobile phone
            - Performance like how the product will perform
