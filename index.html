A <b>marketing strategy</b> refers to a business's overall game plan for reaching prospective consumers and turning them into customers of their products or services

<b>Building blocks of marketing strategy</b> 
- breaking the market into segments 
- selecting one specific segment or two-three segments
- identify competitors on the selected segments
- designing a set of meaningful differences to distinguish the company’s offerings from competitor’s offerings for the selected segments
- create a positive image in the mind of the prospective consumers to maximize the potential benefit to the firm

<b>Segmentation</b>
- The process of dividing the market into various homogeneous groups based on some common parameters is called 'Segmentation'
- 4 fundamental "bases for segmentation" of consumer market. They are as follows, 
    geographic ie, region, city size, density of population, climate
    demographic ie, births, deaths, marriages, age, income, education, occupation
    psychographic ie, lifestyle, their activities, interests, personality, likes and dislikes etc
    behavioral ie, how customers approach the purchase decision and how customers are using your product or service
- The term 'demographics' indicates vital and measurable statistics of human population. Often-used demographic variables are: age, gender, marital status, education, occupation, income and family size
- Segmentation based on the internal self of consumers is known as psychographic segmentation
- While demographics provides the marketer with the 'who' aspect, psychographics provides the 'why' aspect
- Behavioral segmentation divides a population based on their behaviour, with respect to their purchase and usage of the products
    needs and benefits, in case of pad locks, its safety and benefits of jewelry

            heavy user, somebody uses shampoo two times or three times a day
            light user, somebody uses shampoo once a week
        loyalty status, loyalty a strong feeling of support or allegiance to a brand
            hard-core Loyals, who buy the same brand all the time
            split Loyals, loyal to two or three brands
            shifting Loyals, moving from one brand to another
            switchers, with no loyalty
        purchase occasion, that is, special occasion like festivals or office party or your regular purchase

<b>Targeting</b>
- Targeting means selecting one or more identified segments and concentrating on those segments rather than the whole market
- The criteria for selecting the target market/s are 
    segment's size and growth
    segment’s structural attractiveness - Number of competitors, Entry barriers(need government permissions, patents), Exit barrier(lot of fixed assets, lot of customers)
    organization’s objectives and resources
- The various targeting strategies are 
    single segment concentration
    selective specialization
    product specialization
    market specialization 
    whole market coverage

<u>Example for Targeting Strategies</u>,
